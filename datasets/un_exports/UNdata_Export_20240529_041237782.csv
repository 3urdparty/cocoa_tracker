"1","In order to mitigate the wastewater treatment system, a major program for the construction of tailings ponds was launched in 1987 for small and medium-sized towns. The latter resulted in the realization of 435 tailings ponds in 1995 through 31 wilayas."
"2","Our data reports the total amounts of waste water collected instead of the total amount generated. "
